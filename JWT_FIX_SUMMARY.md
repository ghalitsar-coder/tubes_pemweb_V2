# JWT Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

-   **Issue**: Header inconsistency in JWT authentication implementation
-   **Root Cause**: Separate API client (`/lib/api.ts`) bypassed JWT Manager's dual header logic
-   **Secondary Issue**: Unused AuthContext creating confusion

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Client (`/lib/api.ts`)

**Before:**

-   Created separate axios instance with own interceptors
-   Always used `Authorization: Bearer` header
-   Used localStorage for token management

**After:**

-   Removed duplicate interceptors
-   Now relies on JWT Manager's global axios interceptors
-   Consistent with dual header logic

### 2. Removed Unused AuthContext

**Issue:**

-   `AuthContext.tsx` was not used anywhere in the application
-   Created confusion about authentication system
-   Application uses Laravel Inertia.js authentication with props

**Solution:**

-   Deleted unused `resources/js/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
-   Cleaned up unnecessary imports

### 3. Clarified Authentication Architecture

**Actual System:**

-   **Laravel Inertia.js** for web authentication
-   **Props-based auth** (`auth.user`) passed from Laravel
-   **JWT Manager** only for API calls
-   **Dual header logic**: API routes use `Authorization: Bearer`, web routes use `X-Auth-Token`

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Code Changes Complete

1. API client simplified and integrated with JWT Manager
2. Unused AuthContext removed
3. TypeScript compilation successful
4. Build process working correctly

### ✅ Architecture Clarity

-   **Web routes** (Inertia): Use props authentication + `X-Auth-Token` for AJAX
-   **API routes**: Use JWT Manager + `Authorization: Bearer`
-   No localStorage conflicts
-   Single source of truth for token management

### ✅ Route Verification

-   **Project CRUD**: Uses Inertia router with web routes → `X-Auth-Token` ✓
-   **Status 302**: Normal redirect after POST operations ✓
-   **API calls**: Uses axios with `/api/*` routes → `Authorization: Bearer` ✓

## Expected Behavior

1. **Web Operations** (Project CRUD) → Inertia + `X-Auth-Token` for AJAX calls
2. **API Operations** → JWT Manager + `Authorization: Bearer`
3. **Status 302** → Normal redirect response (not an error)
4. **Authentication** → Laravel session + Inertia props (not React Context)

## Files Modified

-   `resources/js/lib/api.ts` - Removed duplicate auth logic
-   `resources/js/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - **DELETED** (unused)

## Files NOT Modified (Working Correctly)

-   `resources/js/utils/jwt.ts` - JWT Manager working correctly
-   All project CRUD operations - Using correct web routes
-   Backend middleware - Supporting both header types correctly

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED + CLEANED UP

The header inconsistency issue has been resolved and unnecessary code removed. The application now has a clean, unified authentication system:

-   **Web routes**: Inertia.js + `X-Auth-Token` for AJAX
-   **API routes**: JWT Manager + `Authorization: Bearer`
-   **Status 302**: Normal and expected behavior for web redirects
